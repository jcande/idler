This program will patiently wait until you've stopped moving before executing another program.

Its command line options are:
	-h		Prints out how to use the program
	-t timeout	Tell the program how long to wait before considering you idle (in seconds)

The default timeout is 10 minutes. You MUST provide a program to run. A typical invocation would
look like: -t 300 slock

To build, link against X11 and Xss (XScreenSaver) with -lX11 -lXss.

The code is pretty readable. I used OpenBSD's sudo(8)'s idea for checking for a valid program. I'm sure
there are thousands of programs like this but I wanted something small to act like a screen saver launcher.
I also wanted to write it in Haskell but such is life.

You can have this program run a script that will set your irssi status, then lock the screen, then unset your
status if you want. Or do anything that relies on idle times, which makes sense.

If you want it to stop running, you must manually kill it.
